<p>Assalamu Alaykum</p>
<p>We are part of the national <a href="https://www.brothersonbikes.cc/">Brothers on Bike Cycling Club</a>. We are a friendly local cycling club sharing faith-based values with our members. You are welcome to join us on our group rides. Please consider the following rules:</p>
<h1 id="clothing-rules---tldr-version-baggies-only-please">Clothing rules - tl;dr version: Baggies only please</h1>
<p>As a club founded by observant Muslims, we expect cyclists joining our rides to adhere to the following clothing rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>The area from the navel to the knees must be covered up</li>
<li>The clothing for this region must NOT be see-through or skin-tight</li>
<li>If tight underlayer shorts/bibs are to be worn then a separate set of short must be worn which is loose and covers all the way down to the knees.</li>
<li>One’s jersey must be long enough, or the shorts high enough at the back, that one’s extreme lower back is not exposed or visible when riding</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="brothers-on-bikes-charter-of-clothing">Brothers on Bikes: Charter of Clothing</h2>
<p>Assalaamu Alaykum,</p>
<p>Our beautiful religion of Islam, for which we have united as avid cyclists up and down the country under this prestigious group, ensures that we not only perfect our worship to Allah but also perfect our day to day living standards.</p>
<p>Our beautiful faith rightly commands that while we have fun and enjoy the pursuit of cycling, the sacred laws of Islam are upheld and that nobody is in any way inconvenienced, be it fellow cyclists, pedestrians or drivers; Muslim or non-Muslim.</p>
<p>Cyclists naturally are expected to don a unique type of clothing that sets them apart from others, clothes that are expected to be figure hugging so as to keep them streamlined and reduce drag, thus increasing speed, enhancing performance and keeping the body warm to maintain suppleness. <strong>Yet&hellip;our Deen comes first and foremost in prioritising our principles.</strong></p>
<p>Islam has a set of moral standards with regards to clothing that is so tight that it shows the contours &amp; shape of those parts of our bodies that are not meant to be exposed.  For men, this would be from the navel down to the knees; we would not be permitted to expose this area or wear tight shorts that show the shape of this region.</p>
<p><strong>The rules for Islamically compatible clothing are thus as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The area from the navel to the knees must be covered up</li>
<li>The clothing for this region must NOT be see-through or skin-tight</li>
<li>If tight underlayer shorts/bibs are to be worn then a separate set of short must be worn which is loose and covers all the way down to the knees.</li>
<li>One’s jersey must be long enough, or the shorts high enough at the back, that one’s extreme lower back is not exposed or visible when riding.</li>
</ul>
<p>This view is of the Hanafi school of Fiqh.  While other schools of thought may slightly differ, all scholars are united in their rulings that the “Satr” (private area of the body to be concealed) is to be covered at all times and that this is from the navel to the knees.  All scholars are unanimous in that tight clothing in this bodily area is at least Makruh detested and therefore not to be adopted.</p>
<p>Ethically, we are not to cause inconvenience to others, especially so to our fellow Muslims. Naturally, for Muslim men it would be very unsavoury and uncomfortable to have to see fellow brothers dressed in such clothing that accentuates their Satr area rather than concealing it.</p>
<p>The desire that we have to shave off mere seconds just to beat our personal bests, is a paltry reason for wishing to emulate cyclists who have no faith or the conscious level of modesty that we Muslims have. We will be gaining far more reward for taking care to wear appropriate clothing that causes no awkwardness for our fellow riders.</p>
